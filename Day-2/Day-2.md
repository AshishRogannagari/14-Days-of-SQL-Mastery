# üöÄ Day 2: SQL Conditional & Null Handling Exercises

## **Introduction**
Welcome to **Day 2 of SQL Mastery!** Today, we focus on handling conditional logic and working with NULL values in SQL. These techniques are essential for real-world data analysis and reporting, ensuring your queries return meaningful insights even with incomplete or complex datasets.

## **What You Will Learn Today**
‚úÖ How to filter records using `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `IS NULL` operators.  
‚úÖ How to apply conditional logic with `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `NULLIF`.  
‚úÖ How to check for existence of related records using `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`.  
‚úÖ How to work with missing or unknown values efficiently.

## üìù **Exercises**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve employees hired between 2018 and 2021.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hiredate BETWEEN '2018-01-01' AND '2021-12-31';
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `BETWEEN` is useful for filtering data within a date range.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees whose salary is between $50,000 and $90,000.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 90000;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `BETWEEN` helps to filter numerical values within a specified range.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Get employees who do not belong to any department (DepartmentID IS NULL).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departmentid IS NULL;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `IS NULL` is used to find records where a column has no value.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve employees who have a manager assigned (ManagerID IS NOT NULL).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE managerid IS NOT NULL;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `IS NOT NULL` ensures we only get employees who have a manager assigned.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees earning more than $100,000 OR hired before 2015.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000 OR hiredate < '2015-01-01';
```
‚úÖ **Why?** The `OR` operator lets you combine multiple conditions.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Get employees in the ‚ÄòEngineering‚Äô department AND earning more than $70,000.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departmentid = (SELECT departmentid FROM departments WHERE name = 'Engineering') AND salary > 70000;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** This query filters employees based on department and salary using a subquery.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve employees in ‚ÄòMarketing‚Äô OR ‚ÄòFinance‚Äô hired after 2017.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departmentid IN (SELECT departmentid FROM departments WHERE name IN ('Marketing', 'Finance')) AND hiredate > '2017-12-31';
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `IN` helps match multiple values from another table.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Show employees who do NOT work in the ‚ÄòHR‚Äô department.**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departmentid <> (SELECT departmentid FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR');
```
‚úÖ **Why?** The `<>` operator helps exclude specific values.

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Classify employees‚Äô salaries as ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô, ‚ÄòMedium‚Äô, or ‚ÄòLow‚Äô using CASE.**
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, salary,
       CASE 
           WHEN salary > 80000 THEN 'High'
           WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000 THEN 'Medium'
           ELSE 'Low' 
       END AS SalaryCategory
FROM employees;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `CASE` allows dynamic categorization of records.

### **üîü Replace NULL manager IDs with 'No Manager' using COALESCE.**
```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, COALESCE(managerid, 'No Manager') AS Manager FROM employees;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `COALESCE` replaces NULL values with a default value.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Return NULL if two employees have the same salary using NULLIF.**
```sql
SELECT employeeid, firstname, salary, NULLIF(salary, (SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE employeeid <> e.employeeid LIMIT 1)) AS UniqueSalary FROM employees e;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `NULLIF` returns NULL if the given values are equal.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees whose email is missing (IS NULL).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email IS NULL;
```
‚úÖ **Why?** Helps identify employees missing contact information.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve employees who have an entry in the Salaries table (EXISTS).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM salaries WHERE salaries.employeeid = employees.employeeid);
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `EXISTS` is used for checking related records.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Get employees who do NOT have salary details in the Salaries table (NOT EXISTS).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM salaries WHERE salaries.employeeid = employees.employeeid);
```
‚úÖ **Why?** `NOT EXISTS` helps find missing records in related tables.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Find employees who have a DepartmentID but the department does NOT exist in the Departments table (NOT EXISTS).**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departmentid IS NOT NULL AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE departments.departmentid = employees.departmentid);
```
‚úÖ **Why?** Helps detect orphaned records where foreign key relations are missing.
